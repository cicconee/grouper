# Grouper
Grouper is a social networking application. Once a user creates an account they can create or join a group. Within groups users can interact with each other using common social networking features. Any interactions within a group are only visible by the group members. These features include posting to the group, commenting on a post, liking a post, etc. As more features are implemented they will be documented under the [Features](#features) section. Any features that are currently in development are listed under the [In Development](#in-development) section.

### What is a Group?
A group is anything you want it to be. It can be a close group of friends, a team, or a place where random individuals share similar interests. Make sure to give your group a meaningful name.
